terminal-slime
--------------

Is the port of vim-slime into Emacs. It allows to send a text from Emacs to Tmux
and GNU Screen panels. It is handy for sending commands to remote terminals with
a lot of lag. It can also be  used to send text for evaluation to panels running
a REPL or in general to any program which accepts input on STDIN.

The program defines a  keybinding 'C-c C-c'. When pressed for  the first time it
prompts a  user to  identify the  panel to send  the text  to. The  program then
remembers the panel  and doesn't ask the  user anymore. The user  can change the
panel to send text to by pressing 'C-c C-v'.

A user  can specify a  region before sending  it to a  panel. When no  region is
selected a paragraph under a current point is selected as the region to send.

When using  GNU Screen the user  is informed with  a message in the  status line
about  commands  issued  by  terminal-slime.  The  messages  block  the  program
execution and for a better user experience it  is advised to set msgwait to 0 in
a screen's configuration file.
