terminal-slime
--------------

Is the port of vim-slime into Emacs. It allows to send a text from Emacs to Tmux
and GNU  Screen panels. It is  especially handy when sending  commands to remote
terminals with a lot of lag. It can also be used to send text to REPL.

When using  GNU Screen you  can set msgwait  to 0 in  .screenrc to not  wait for
messages to disappear before sending the text.
